## Introducing Today's Project!

In this project, I will demonstrate how to automate browser tasks using AI agents. I'm doing this project to learn about browser automation, streamline repetitive tasks, and gain experience with tools like WebUI, Google AI Studio API, and Python scripting.

### Tools and concepts

Services I used were Google AI Studio for the API key, Playwright for browser automation, and WebUI for configuring and running the AI agent. Key concepts I learnt include browser automation, task description writing, and setting up AI models for web interaction.

### Project reflection

This project took me approximately 1 hour. The most challenging part was troubleshooting agent errors, but it was most rewarding to see the agent navigate websites and return accurate data with AI assistance.

I did this project today to improve my skills in AI automation and browser interaction. It met my goals by helping me understand how AI models can be used for real-time browser tasks and how to troubleshoot common issues in automation.

## Development Environment

WebUI is an open-source interface for Browser Use that simplifies creating AI browser agents. To retrieve WebUI's code, you need to clone the repository from GitHub, set up a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the WebUI server locally.

I installed Python, Pip, UV, and Git because these are the necessary development tools to run WebUI and automate browser tasks. Python allows the execution of WebUI, while Pip and UV manage dependencies, and Git downloads the source code for WebUI.

I set up a virtual environment by running the `uv venv` command and activating it. A virtual environment is helpful for isolating the project's dependencies, ensuring that the required packages don't interfere with other Python projects on my system.

## Configuring My API

An API key is needed because it serves as an access pass to connect WebUI to the AI model. It helps WebUI by enabling communication with the AI model (e.g., Google AI Studio), allowing the agent to understand tasks, make decisions, and perform actions in the browser.

I set up my API key by logging into Google AI Studio, creating a new key, and copying it. Then, I configured WebUI to use it by going to the LLM Configuration tab, selecting Gemini as the provider, and pasting the API key into the appropriate field.

## Running The Agent

My first agent's task was to search for "OpenAI" on Google and provide the first URL. The agent by default launches Chromium, which is the browser engine that powers Google Chrome and is used by WebUI for its browser automation tasks.

The agent interacts with the browser by using Playwright to locate and interact with web elements such as buttons and links. I can see this when the browser highlights clickable elements with coloured boxes, showing the agent's real-time actions.

The Results tab shows the outcome of the agent's task, like the first URL found from searching "OpenAI" on Google. This is helpful because it allows you to verify the agent's actions and ensure that it completed the task as expected. You can also watch a video of the agent's actions to confirm its behavior.

## Debugging and Logs

When my agent encounters an error, three common reasons are that the task description lacks a clear output format, making it unclear whether the agent should return a list of URLs, a paragraph, or some other result. Another issue can be a complex website structure that the agent struggles to navigate, preventing it from finding the necessary information. Lastly, some websites block automated access, which can halt the agent's progress, as it is unable to interact with the site as intended.

The terminal logs show detailed information about the actions the agent attempted and any errors that occurred during the task. This helps me understand how the agent is interacting with the website, what actions were successful, and where it might have encountered issues or missteps.
